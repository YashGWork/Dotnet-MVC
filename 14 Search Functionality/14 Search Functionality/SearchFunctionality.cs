1) To Install Entity Framework to use Database First Approach

2) To add a data model as ADO.NET using database first approach and the rebuilding the solution. As a result we will get a database model file and context file to interact (perform CRUD operations) with the database. 

3) Add a controller with views using Entity Framework by selecting the Model and Data context classs so that it automatically generates CRUD logic and views. 

4) To add a search functionality we will create a form in Index view to take the user input to search by name or gender and edit the index action method in HomeController to process the search request.
